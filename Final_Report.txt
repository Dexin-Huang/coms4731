The format of the final report should contain the following sections--it should read like a standard research conference paper:

Introduction
Related Work
Method Overview
Experiments and Results
Discussions
Conclusions
Please make sure all team members names and UNIs are at the top with the title of the report.  There is no expectation on page count, but figure 8-12 pages is a reasonable target length.
